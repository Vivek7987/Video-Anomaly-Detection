# Video-Anomaly-Detection
AI-Powered Video Anomaly Detection This project leverages AI techniques to detect anomalies in videos using object detection. Built with Python and Streamlit, the system allows users to upload videos, where it automatically processes each frame to identify anomalies based on object detection models like YOLOv8.
